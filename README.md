* Client-side programs in React.js
* Server-side programs in Express (Node.js)
* Socket.io to connect client-side and server-side

### My Contribution

Design the user interface and the functions.

### Reflection
* Learn much about socket.io, and how it play with React.js
* It's hard and waste time to design a good-looking UI, so I still need to be familiar with some  Internet source ,like bootstrap...
