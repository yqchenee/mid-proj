* Your word list will be sorted by `Times appeared` of each word in descending order. (My main function!)
* You can add your vocabulary words by entering the text fields on the side, and press `ADD WORD`.
* If a word was already in your word list, the number of `Times appeared` on the card will increase and the card will move forward.
* You can delete the word by pressing the `delete` icon, or you can clear the whole word list by pressing `DELETE ALL` on the side.
* Switch the `Flip Cards` on the side can change your cards to flippable cards, enable you to start learning your vocabulary words.


### Development
* Client-side programs in React.js
* Server-side programs in Express (Node.js)
* Database in Mongodb

### My Contribution

Design the user interface and the functions, and all the implementation except the packages mensioned above.

### Reflection

* Their are lots of useful packages available for your react app, like material-ui makes my app's interface a little bit like Google's.
* Using server to do some action is quite convenient XD
* The bugs I met while using `socket.io` still confused me a lot...
